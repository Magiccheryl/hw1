        <h1>Stop Fighting Fatigue the Wrong Way!</h1>
        <p>If you reach for a coffee or do a hard workout when you are tired, you may be hurting your ability to re-energize.</p>
        <p>Here’s why. When you’re stressed, your adrenal glands produce cortisol, the stress hormone. After the stressful event, your cortisol crashes, and you become fatigued. By drinking caffeine or doing a tough workout, you are only further stimulating cortisol production. When our bodies have been triggering cortisol production over a long period of time, your body is no longer able to appropriately respond. This leads to extreme fatigue which we call “Adrenal Fatigue”, further described as HPA Axis Dysregulation.</p>
        <p>Rather than coffee, you need the nutrients to help solve the root cause of fatigue. The Adrenal Drink contains natural, sugar-free electrolytes that help keep you hydrated and provide the Vitamin C, Sodium, and Potassium your adrenal glands need for proper functioning.</p>

        <h1>What is The Adrenal Drink?</h1>
        <p>We can’t take credit for the Adrenal Drink recipe. The original Adrenal Drink was developed by, Susan Blackard, NP, ND, Ph.D., at the Rejuvenation Health Center (Springfield, MO) and popularized by Morley Robbins of the Root Cause Protocol. Recommended by naturopathic doctors, The Adrenal Drink delivers three key nutrients needed for strong adrenal function to keep your body and cortisol levels in check.</p>
        <h3>Whole Food Vitamin C (240mg)</h3>

        <p>The body’s highest concentration of vitamin C is in the adrenal glands, and a Vitamin C deficiency can reduce your body’s ability to appropriately respond to stress. Unlike typical supplements, The Adrenal Drink’s Whole Food Vitamin C is not processed, which allows the body to fully absorb the benefits of the vitamin. </p>
        <h3>Pure Mineral Salt (460mg)</h3>
        <img src="https://theadrenaldrink.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/salt-1536x1024.jpg">
        <p>Low sodium can lead to dehydration and low blood pressure, which can worsen the effects of fatigue. Real salt includes 80 trace minerals that simply don’t exist in conventional refined table salt (the white salt most of us grew up using). The body needs these key minerals, and potassium, to effectively use sodium. What’s more, our potassium helps mitigate some of sodium’s more potentially problematic effects by encouraging the kidneys to excrete excess sodium – a check and balance put in place by nature.</p>
        <h3>Potassium Bicarbonate (375mg)</h3>
        <img src="https://theadrenaldrink.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/powder-600x400.jpg">
        <p>Potassium is an essential mineral for regulating fluid balance and nerve signals. In the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the FDA announced the underconsumption of potassium a public health concern. We use cream of tartar for the source of potassium.</p>
